        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Okay so I decided to do a review site on something I love which is sneakers. Below you will find a list of iconic moments tied to sneakers in that I have chosen to review. I chose these 6 sneakers because the Jordan 1-5 is what started the legacy of MJ outside of basketball and made the man immortal in the streets. Ending it off on a high note with the Jordn 6 that cemented his legacy in basketball after winning his first of six NBA Finals. After you read about the iconic moments on the home page feel free to browse the sneakers listed in the navigation to get more information on the sneaks. Hope you enjoy!</p>
