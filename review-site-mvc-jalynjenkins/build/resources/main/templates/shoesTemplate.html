        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Pack Johnson Studios or Pack Johnson is a vintage clothing showroom and multi-media studio based out of the heart of the Midwest. Our products are reliably sourced from all over the WORLD (yes we said world). Our goal is to provide our customers with a unique and fulfilling experience rather shopping online or in person. Everything in our inventory is specifically curated by our staff to ensure the quality of our product keeps it’s integrity through its life cycle. The 4 core values we strive to exude through every interaction include
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sustainability- Meeting the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs. Doing our part to reduce, reuse and recycle.</li>
            <li>Originality- Sourcing from all over the globe ensures that the products you are buying are one of a kind. No two pieces in the shop are the same.</li>
            <li>Value- We do not believe in over pricing just because something is considered “vintage”. Competitive pricing is something we whole heartedly stand by.</li>
            <li>Love- All we can do in this world as humans is spread the love through our walk. We hope to spread love to our customers and our customers spread that love out in the world.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Here at Pack Johnson Studios we live and breathe vintage.  Without your support all we do is for nothing. If by any means you feel we have not done our all to walk by the values stated above feel free to contact us.</p>
        <p>Signed,</p>
        <p>Pack Johnson</p>

        <h2>Our Products</h2>
        <h3>Sustainable Materials</h3>
        <p>Did you know that 85% of our clothes end up in landfills or burned? Furthermore, it is estimated that the average American throws away about 81 pounds of clothes every year. So to do our part to keep these oh so precious garments out of those huge trash piles we built a business out of raiding grandma’s drawers, grandpa’s closet and the attics of hoarders. Every piece specially hand picked to our liking and hopefully to yours too. Just a small gesture in our minds of making the world a better place for the generations that succeed us.</p>
